Put loading gif when searching for ingredients starting with characters indicated
If I can use autocomplete I will. Otherwise, put the options under the search bar.
I cannot crawl the internet for recipes, so this application will be more about
storing personal recipes. 
For each recipe, I think about having a picture of the plate, summary, list of 
ingredients, and instructions.
I think about storing recipes as JSON objects to get used to JSON.
It would be good to look at design patterns to get used to them. I have already
used the singleton in AllIngredients and FridgeIngredients classes.
